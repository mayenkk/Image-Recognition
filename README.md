## Introduction

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image recognition project is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of deep learning in image classification tasks. It uses the Python programming language and popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The main components of the project include:

- Data preprocessing: preparing and preprocessing the image dataset for training.
- Model architecture: defining the CNN architecture for image classification.
- Training: training the CNN model on the provided dataset.
- Evaluation: assessing the performance of the trained model on test data.
- Model deployment: deploying the trained model for real-world use.

The project provides a foundation for understanding CNNs, image recognition techniques, and deep learning model deployment.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mayenkk/Image-Recognition.git
cd image-recognition-project
```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the dataset or prepare your own dataset (see [Dataset](#dataset) section).

## Usage

To run the image recognition project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the dataset available (see [Dataset](#dataset) section).

2. Execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. The script will load the dataset, train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance.

4. Once the training is complete, the trained model will be saved.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is not included in this repository due to its size. You can provide your own dataset or download a suitable dataset from external sources. Some popular image recognition datasets include:

- [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/)

Ensure that the dataset is properly structured and organized before proceeding with training.

## Training

The training process involves the following steps:

1. Load the dataset.

2. Preprocess the data (e.g., resizing, normalization).

3. Define the CNN model architecture (e.g., number of layers, filters, activation functions), in this case 2 Convolutional Layers, and 3 fully connected layers.

4. Compile the model with suitable loss function and optimizer.

5. Train the model using the prepared dataset.

6. Save the trained model for later use.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the trained model, a separate test dataset is used. The evaluation process involves:

1. Load the test dataset.

2. Preprocess the test data in a similar manner as during training.

3. Load the trained model.

4. Make predictions on the test data using the loaded model.

5. Calculate relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

6. Present the evaluation results.

## Model Deployment

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed for real-world use. There are various ways to deploy a deep learning model, depending on the specific requirements of your application. Some common deployment methods include:

- Integrating the model into a web application or mobile app.
-

 Building an API to serve predictions.
- Deploying the model on cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure.

Choose the deployment strategy that best fits your needs and refer to the documentation of the respective platforms or frameworks for guidance.
